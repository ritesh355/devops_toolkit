# AutoGit Tool

This script automates the creation of a GitHub repository using the GitHub CLI (`gh`) and pushes a newly initialized Git project to it.

## 🔧 Usage

```bash
./autogit.sh <project_name> [public|private]
```

- `project_name`: Name of your GitHub project
- `public|private`: Visibility (optional, defaults to public)

## ✅ Example

```bash
./autogit.sh devops_toolkit public
```

## 🛠️ Requirements

- GitHub CLI (`gh`)
- Git installed
- GitHub account authenticated (`gh auth login`)

# 🚀 My Complete DevOps Projects Collection – From Beginner to Advanced (All in One Place)

Over the last few months, I’ve been learning DevOps deeply and building real-world projects using tools like **Docker, Jenkins, AWS, GitHub Actions, Ansible, Terraform, Lambda, MongoDB, CloudFront, Prometheus, Grafana, and more**.

To organize everything, I created a single repository called **DevOps_Projects**, where I have added **all my DevOps, Cloud, and CI/CD projects**, each inside its own folder.

This blog is a complete guide to my journey — what I built, what tools I used, and what I learned from each project.

Whether you're a beginner or someone preparing for DevOps interviews, this collection will help you understand real DevOps concepts with practical implementation.

# 🎯 Why I Created This Repository

As a fresher, one thing became clear:

> **Companies don’t want just theoretical knowledge — they want proof of hands-on experience.**

So instead of building random mini projects, I decided to learn DevOps properly and build **real-world, practical, production-like projects**.

This repository is the outcome of that journey.  
And I will keep adding more advanced projects as I grow.

# 📂 What’s Inside This Repository?

Each project has its **own folder**, containing:

- Complete project code  
- Dockerfiles  
- CI/CD workflows  
- Configuration files  
- Project-specific README  
- Architecture diagrams (for some projects)

Below is the complete list of projects included so far:
